# PureCloud Swift Style Guide

The following guide should be used for Swift code formatting and styling [Ray Wenderlich Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide#access-control) with the exception of minor changes listed on this page.

## Spacing

Indent using 4 spaces rather than tabs to conserve space and help prevent line wrapping.

## Comments

Please check out https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode for generating comments for methods, classes, etc.

When they are needed, use comments to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Comments must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Avoid block comments inline with code, as the code should be as self-documenting as possible. *Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.*
